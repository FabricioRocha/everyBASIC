Very much a clone of [[.:|Applesoft BASIC]] which proclaimed to be //almost// 100% compatible.

===== Where it is/was used =====
/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */
  * Multi-Tech (Acer) Micro-Professor II (Taiwan, 1982)
  * Microdigital TK-2000 (Brazil, 1984)

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====
/* TO DO: a list or prose text about this BASIC's features, quirks, Easter eggs, tricks, singularities... */

In order to be cheaper in the Asian market, the MPF-II computer did not have a real text mode that would require a special and expensive character generator. It had no joystick port and its keyboard and second video buffer were not located in the same memory addresses of the Apple II family, so many of the [[:keywords:PEEK]]s and [[:keywords:POKE]]s of Applesoft program listings would not work under its BASIC. Also, its [[:keywords:GET]] statement worked in blocking mode.

It is not clear so far whether the BASIC on the MPF-II was a licensed version of Applesoft or a reverse-engineered clone.

Brazilian clone TK-2000 had a Disk-II compatible controller in the form of a cartridge and its BASIC had some keywords not found in Applesoft and possibly not even in the MPF-II, such as [[:keywords:SOUND]], [[:keywords:MOTOR]] and [[:keywords:DSK]].
