Don't let the name and the "js" in the tag name fool you: [[https://github.com/JoeStrout/minibasic|Joe Strout's MiniBASIC]], announced at February 26th, 2023, has no relationship with the previous [[.minibasicmm|Malcolm McLean's minibasic]] project, nor is it a JavaScript implementation.

Beware of the differential letters here as well, because, out of pure coincidence, Joe's MiniBASIC runs on his **[[https://joestrout.itch.io/mini-micro|Mini Micro]]**, a kind of a virtual, fantasy retrocomputer emulator. An online, browser-based version with some limitations is available at https://joestrout.itch.io/minibasic (last checked 2023-03-01). Joe's MiniBASIC is implemented using Mini Micro's own language, called //Mini Script//, and is supposedly easily extensible with it. 



===== Where it is/was used =====
/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */
  * **[[https://joestrout.itch.io/mini-micro|Mini Micro]]** fantasy 1980s computer emulator

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====

Simplicity with 8-bit, 1980s retro flavour is surely the goal of this [[linenumbered|line-numbered]] BASIC interpreter, whose //"feature set is just a bit beyond the best of the 1980s home computer"// with //"all the little bits of polish that didn't exist at the time"//, in the author's words ((https://dev.to/joestrout/announcing-minibasic-1i6f, last checked 2023-03-01)). It implements a subset of the most common [[ms80basic|Microsoft-based interpreters]] of the golden era, with traces of [[.:applesoft:|Applesoft]] inclination, just enough to be able to run some games and simple type-in programs (some are included as examples).



===== Environment and usage =====
