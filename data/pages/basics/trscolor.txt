Mostly known by the Tandy/Radio Shack "CoCo" line of computers, this was a family of BASICs also developed by Microsoft but with some differences to the [[.trs80:|TRS-80]] Level I and Level II BASICs. It equipped a number of contemporary machines with the Motorola 6809 and derived processors with a number of variations.
