The customized [[ms80basic|Microsoft BASIC]] for the Apple II, first sold in cassette tape before improved and incorporated into the ROM of the 1978 Apple II+, displacing Stephen Wozniak's original [[a2int|INTEGER BASIC]].

Apple engineers adapted the original BASIC-65 port of Microsoft BASIC-80 in order to incorporate most keywords already in use in INTEGER BASIC. Though slower, Applesoft brought floating-point maths support to the Apple II and is generally described as a more complete and useful BASIC.
