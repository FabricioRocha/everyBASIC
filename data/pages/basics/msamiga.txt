The short-lived Microsoft BASIC for Amiga was one of the first implementations of [[structured|structured BASIC]] by Microsoft. It was released shortly after [[msmac]] and both were said to be remarkably similar â€” as much as we can see what [[msqb]] was about to become.

The Microsoft BASIC for the Amiga officially replaced the original [[amiga|ABasiC]] shipped with the machine, but had only one version, for the Amiga Workbench 1.3.

===== Where it is/was used =====

The "Extras" Amiga disk contained MBASIC, shown by an incon entitled "AmigaBASIC". When running, it would show two windows:
  * "LIST", where a program stored in memory could be seen. It had menus and "advanced editor features" such as cut/copy/paste (quite a blast from the line editors of previous machines);
  * "BASIC", also known as the "OUTPUT" window, quite similar to the "Immediate" area of future [[qbasic]], where commands could be typed, statements could be tested, variables could be checked and so on.
