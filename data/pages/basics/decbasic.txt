One of the oldest and most influential BASIC implementations, developed by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and released in 1970.

It is said to be highly influenced by JOSS, a Rand Corporation time-sharing programming language which also influenced other languages such as FOCAL and MUMPS((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOSS)).
