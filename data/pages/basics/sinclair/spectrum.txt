It is possible that the 1982 Spectrum is the most iconic of the Sinclair computers, as much a British symbol as the BBC Micro. It finally brought true graphics and 8 //colours// to the family, with an again-doubled BASIC compared to the [[..:sinclair:zx81|ZX81]], curiously reinstating some keywords from the original [[..:sinclair|ZX80]] version which had been left out by its predecessor.
