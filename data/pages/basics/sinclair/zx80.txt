The tiny Sinclair ZX-80 had an incomplete implementation of [[:basics:ansi:ansimin|ANSI Minimal BASIC]] made by Nine Tiles Networks, England. It only had integer arithmetic in order to fit into 4KB of ROM.

===== Where it is/was used =====
/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */
  * Sinclair ZX-80

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====
/* TO DO: a list or prose text about this BASIC's features, quirks, Easter eggs, tricks, singularities... */
  * Every line of code should start with a command, due to the way the REPL interface and keyboard entry were implemented. This made [[:keywords:LET]] mandatory in assignments, unlike most other BASICs.

===== Environment and usage =====

/* TO DO: notes about the REPL or IDE used, keyboard shortcuts and commands, command-line options for compiling and linking, environment variables which might be set... */


===== Extensions =====
/* TO DO: Famous libraries tools and extension packages made for this BASIC */


===== Curiosities =====
/* TO DO: Historical notes, anecdotes, what people said about it */


===== Related to... =====
/*   * **[[basicTagName|basicTitle]]** - TO DO: a brief description of the relation they have with this one */


==== Influenced by ====
/*  * **[[basicTagName|basicTitle]]** - TO DO: which are the noticeable or assumed influences */


==== Influence for ====

===== Versions and successors =====
/*
  No much need of prose here, just links. Notice the different patterns to create the links:
    * **[[basics:sinclair:versionTagName|versionTitle]]** - for versions (created under this page)
    * **[[successorTagName|successorTitle]]** - for a successor (created as sibling of this page)
