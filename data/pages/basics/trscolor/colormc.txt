This was a version of the original [[..trscolor:|Color BASIC]], with apparently very few differences, which equipped smaller and cheaper microcomputers based on the Motorola 6803 processor. In spite of the similarity, programs saved in one machine (if not as text) would not run at the other, due to differences in tokenization of keywords((https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n10/39_The_TRS80_MC10_too_lit.php, last check 2023-03-13)). It is still alive as an open-source cross-compiler as of 2023.

  * [[https://github.com/gregdionne/mcbasic|mcbasic]], an open-source cross compiler by Greg Dionne, apparently tested on Windows 10 and MacOS, that compiles Micro Color BASIC 1.0 code for the MC-10 computer. As of 2023-03-13, the README file admitted that some keywords like [[:keywords:LPRINT]] and [[:keywords:USR]] were not supported.
