For its third version of the "CoCo" Color Computer in 1986, Tandy wanted an update of its BASIC, but could not get Microsoft to provide anything((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_3_(1986%E2%80%931991))). So they hired Microware for providing a patch that would piggyback onto Microsoft's [[.:colorext|Extended Color BASIC]] loaded from ROM, adding some new commands (and bugs) to it.

It was also known as "Super Extended Color BASIC"((https://www.cocopedia.com/wiki/index.php/BASIC:BASIC, last check 2023-03-14)).

/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */
  * Tandy Color Computer 3 (USA, 1986)

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====

The CoCo 3 Advanced Color Video Chip, also known as GIME, had improved graphics capabilities. This BASIC extension added a set of graphical statements to take advantage of the new high-resolution video mode, typically started with "H", such as [[:keywords:HPAINT]], [[:keywords:HPRINT]], [[:keywords:HDRAW]] and [[:keywords:HLINE]]. An exception to the H rule was [[:keywords:LOCATE]], which was somewhat similar to its "meaning" in other Microsoft BASICs, but here worked for text output within this high-res mode. Also, this BASIC had commands for defining color palettes for RGB or composite video.

Error handling was improved by [[:keywords:ERLIN]], [[:keywords:ERR]] and [[:keywords:ERNO]].
