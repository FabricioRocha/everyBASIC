A disk-based extension to the original [[..:atari:|Atari BASIC]], made by Shepardson Microsystems and distributed by Optimized Systems Software (OSS) in 1981. It modified some commands and made them faster, while bringing in 43 new instructions for graphics, games development and debugging.

===== Where it is/was used =====
/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */
  * Atari 800

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====
/* TO DO: a list or prose text about this BASIC's features, quirks, Easter eggs, tricks, singularities... */

Commands were implemented for accessing the Atari's "Player-Missile Graphics" (PMG) which had been ignored by the original Atari BASIC.

===== Environment and usage =====

/* TO DO: notes about the REPL or IDE used, keyboard shortcuts and commands, command-line options for compiling and linking, environment variables which might be set... */

The OS/A+ disk should be placed in drive 1 then the machine should be powered on. At the "D1:" prompt, typing BASIC would load the extension. From DOS, the LOAD BINARY FILE menu option could be used for loading A+ from its disk.

===== Extensions =====
/* TO DO: Famous libraries tools and extension packages made for this BASIC */


===== Curiosities =====
