A commercial BASIC for Windows with a free trial version, as of 2023, whose [[https://www.libertybasic.com/|website]] makes you think it was abandoned by the early 2000s, but in fact it remains alive and updated. Has a pretty extensive [[http://www.libertybasicuniversity.com/lb4help/|documentation]] online.

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====
/* TO DO: a list or prose text about this BASIC's features, quirks, Easter eggs, tricks, singularities... */
  * In its full version, Liberty BASIC compiles code to an "intermediary format", per the docs, and requires runtime DLLs (dynamic loaded libraries) to be distributed along its applications, much like [[:basics:vb|MS Visual Basic]].

  * A visual interface designer, Free Form, generates code which can be edited. It is written with the language itself.
