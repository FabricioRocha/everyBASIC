The infamous, late and mostly failed attempt to create an official, worldwide specification for BASICs. Only its smallest, ultra-limited and already dated **Minimal BASIC** portion was somehow implemented (mostly because it //already had been//). In fact, the **Standard BASIC** specification has some conflicts with the Minimal spec â€” and that's why both are treated here in different pages, not in a subset- or extension- relationship; and also why this page is out of standard.

===== Versions and successors =====
Okay, so here are the ANSI BASICs, and official specification documents are available from each one's page:
 
  *[[.:ansimin|Minimal BASIC]]
  *[[.:ansifull|Standard or "Full" BASIC]]


===== Noteworthy differences =====
  * Minimal BASIC defined 26 keywords and 11 functions. Standard BASIC defined 176 keywords and 52 functions.

  * Minimal BASIC programs should have lines numbered from 0 to 9999. Standard BASIC would accept 50000 lines of code, but would not allow line number 0. 

  * [[:keywords:LET]] was optional in Minimal BASIC, as in many other real-life BASICs before it. In Full BASIC it became mandatory.

  * Full BASIC defined ''!'' as an abbreviation for the [[:keywords:REM]] comments keyword. Minimal BASIC did not define an abbreviation, but the much more common apostrophe had been adopted by 1970's [[:basics:dartmouth:dartmouth5|Dartmouth Fifth Edition]].
