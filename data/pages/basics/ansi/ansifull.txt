More informally known as **ANSI Full BASIC**, this is the long-but-no-so-awaited specification ANSI and ECMA came up with many years after the X3J2 committee was formed to define what BASIC would officially be like.

===== Where it is/was used =====
/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */


===== Noteworthy characteristics =====
/* TO DO: a list or prose text about this BASIC's features, quirks, Easter eggs, tricks, singularities... */


===== Environment and usage =====

/* TO DO: notes about the REPL or IDE used, keyboard shortcuts and commands, command-line options for compiling and linking, environment variables which might be set... */


===== Extensions =====
/* TO DO: Famous libraries tools and extension packages made for this BASIC */


===== Curiosities =====
/* TO DO: Historical notes, anecdotes, what people said about it */

The [[:basics:bwbasic:|Bywater BASIC]] manual/README file says: "The ANSI Standard for full BASIC does not specify which particular commands or functions must be implemented, and in fact the standard is very robust. Perhaps no implementation of BASIC would ever include all of the items"((https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/bwbasic.1.html)).

  * [[:basics:truebasic:|TrueBASIC]] - by Kemeny and Kurtz, probably the first admitted attempt to create an implementation according to the standard (or part of it at least)
  * [[:basics:msqb:|Microsoft QuickBASIC]] - probably in order to be able to sell its BASIC to government agencies, Microsoft also had a look at the ANSI standard and took some ideas from it for its highly sucessfull second-generation, structured BASIC
  * [[:basics:decimal|Decimal BASIC]] - a 21st-century open-source, multiplatform IDE/interpreter which strives to follow the standard
