The very limited specification made by the first ANSI committee created to set a standard for the BASIC language. It was not much more than a formalization of [[..:dartmouth:dartmouth1|the original Version 1 of Dartmouth BASIC]]. Apparently, the X3J2 committee just wanted to show //something// quickly without having to discuss too much.



===== Where it is/was used =====
/* TO DO: Machines and emulators which ran this BASIC. */


===== Noteworthy characteristics =====
/* TO DO: a list or prose text about this BASIC's features, quirks, Easter eggs, tricks, singularities... */


===== Environment and usage =====

/* TO DO: notes about the REPL or IDE used, keyboard shortcuts and commands, command-line options for compiling and linking, environment variables which might be set... */


===== Extensions =====
/* TO DO: Famous libraries tools and extension packages made for this BASIC */


===== Curiosities =====
/* TO DO: Historical notes, anecdotes, what people said about it */

According to Arthur Luehrmann, the ANSI X3J2 committee was made up of around 30 members who, in the end, knew that the Minimal BASIC specification was "more a toy than an actual language", that would still have to be enhanced to become useful, probably in non-standard ways.
