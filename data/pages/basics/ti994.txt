The BASIC developed by Texas Instruments for their pioneer 16-bit home computers 99/4 (1979) and 99/4A (1981). The user manual of this last machine was the guide for its implemented keywords listed here. The machines were plagued by hardware decisions, but TI BASIC was a very complete implementation of the language with some exclusive and interesting features.

===== Where it is/was used =====

  * Texas Instruments TI-99/4 and TI 99/4A

**[[.:ti994:ti994ext|TI Extended Basic]]** was a cartridge released by TI in 1981 with a lot of features highly missed.

===== Curiosities =====
/* TO DO: Historical notes, anecdotes, what people said about it */
Twice the word size, half the performance: the TI 99/4 machines were remarkably slow and their BASIC suffered the most. The Sieve of Erastothenes benchmark by BYTE Magazine took 3960 seconds, while the Apple II could do it in 2806 seconds.((BYTE Magazine, January 1983.
