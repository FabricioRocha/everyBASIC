The extremely popular and successful computers from England-based legendary **Sinclair Research** were shipped with BASICs developed by Nine Tiles Networks Ltd, also an English company. These BASICs were pretty similar among its own evolutions and also to [[.:ms80basic:|Microsoft BASIC-80]]-based interpreters which were so common at the time. It was not hard to port programs written for the Sinclair Spectrum to a [[:basics:MSX:]] machine, for example.
