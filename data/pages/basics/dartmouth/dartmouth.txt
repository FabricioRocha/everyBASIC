The original BASIC from John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, first released in 1964. Much has been written about it already, so we don't have to tell all its glorious history here. It had 8 versions, the last one released in 1980, and became a major reference to the [[ansibasic|ANSI BASIC]] specifications.
