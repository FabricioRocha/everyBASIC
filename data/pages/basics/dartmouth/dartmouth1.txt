The very first BASIC ever written, with its 15 keywords.

===== Where it is/was used =====
  * GE-225 and Datanet DN-30, the pair known and sold as GE-265

===== Noteworthy characteristics =====

  * [[:keywords:LET]] was //required// for assignments and expressions. A direct mention of a variable was not valid, as it became in later BASICs.
  * Every variable might be used as an array of 10 elements, numbered from 1, even without being declared with [[:keywords:DIM]].
  * It was //not// meant to create interactive programs. No [[:keyword:INPUT]], dear. The [[:keywords:DATA]] statement was the original way to give something for the program to munch.
===== Environment and usage =====
