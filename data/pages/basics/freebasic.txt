One of the (if not //the//) most stable open-source BASICs [[https://www.freebasic.net/|in activity]] as of 2023, FreeBASIC is a large, modern and multi-platform compiler which started mostly influenced by [[.:msqb:|Microsoft QuickBASIC]] but, as time passed, adopted some influences from C++ to the point it had to work with separate "language modes" â€” one for QB compatibility and one of its own, which is the one considered for the [[:keywords:|Keywords Reference]] section of this site.
