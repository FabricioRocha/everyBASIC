The BASIC used in the famous 8-bit Commodore machines such as PET, VIC-20, C64, 16, Plus/4 and C128. Originally, it was pretty much the Microsoft port of its [[:basics:ms80basic|BASIC-80]] for the 6502 processor, later improved by Commodore developers into a number of versions with some meaningful differences. None of them however was nearly as popular as the one known as *V2*, which is the baseline to what this site refers to as "Commodore BASIC".

===== Versions and successors =====
Commodore's numbering scheme for the versions of its BASIC was, well, awkward. It does not follow the chronological order of releases as told by Wikipedia, here simplified:

  * After V1 for the PET 2001 with calculator keyboard, came the first release of V2 for the newer PET 2001
  * **[[~:cbmv4|Commodore BASIC V4]]** was launched with the PET/CBM 4000 and 8000 series
  * Then V2 had its second release with the VIC-20, and would later be used with the C64 as well
  * **[[~:cbmv4plus|Commodore BASIC V4+]]** was then released with the CBM-II machines
  * **[[~cbmv3.5|Commodore BASIC V3.5]]** came with the C16 and Plus/4 machines
  * **[[~cbmv7|Commodore BASIC V7]]** was the last released version with the C128
  
  * **[[https://github.com/mist64/cbmbasic|cbmbasic]]** is an open-source, portable C version of Commodore BASIC V2 which claims to be 100% compatible and has been tested on MacOS X, Linux and Windows NT.
