====== BASICs we know of ======

I would not put money on anyone who proclaimed to know //every// BASIC ever made, but here is a humble attempt to take note of known interpreters, compilers, environment and versions of the language.

There is a tag for each of them, and they build a taxonomy used throughout this site, especially in the Reference section.
