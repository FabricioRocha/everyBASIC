**With variations:** [[:basics:hptsb:]], [[:basics:CBM:Simons1]], [[:basics:trs80:]] (introduced PRINT [[AT]]), [[:basics:trs80:level2]] (also PRINT@), [[:basics:trs80:trsdisk]] (with # for writing to file), [[:basics:trs80:level3]] (the PRINT#-3 variation), [[:basics:MicroColorBASIC:]], [[:basics:Sinclair:spectrum]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]]

**Also written as: ** /* Alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later. */

===== Usage =====

PRINT has some punctuation formatting available since its begginings:
  * When the string to be printed has nothing after it, a new line is automatically inserted.
  * When the string(s) to be printed are separated or followed by **comma**, a tabulation is inserted instead of a new line. The tab size is machine dependent.
  * When the string(s) to be printed are separated or followed by **semicolon**, nothing is inserted and the following string or PRINT will happen right after.
    * Exception: positive numbers have a space printed before them because of an "invisible" sign.((SANDERS, William B. //The Amiga Microsoft BASIC Programmer's Guide//.))
