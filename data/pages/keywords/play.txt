====== PLAY ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Plays a tune described by a MIDI-ish "musical macro language", a string of octaves, notes, volumes, etc. Alternatively, controls event triggering from this musical score. Can also be used as a function, but return type and values are implementation-dependent.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:CBM:cbmv7]], [[:basics:trscolor:colorext]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:VBDOS:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:CBM:Simons1]], [[:basics:MSX:]] (uses macro language), [[:basics:msqb:QBasic]] (with ON/OFF/STOP and macro language; also as function and as [[ON]] PLAY [[GOSUB]]), [[:basics:ugBASIC:]] (note, duration, channels; also with OFF)

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

Used as a function in [[:basics:msqb|MS QuickBasic/QBasic]], PLAY returns the number of notes still to be played in its musical commands string. The given numerical argument for such usage is simply ignored.



==== Variations ====
In [[:basics:msx|MSX BASIC]], PLAY can be used as a function to query the free (0) or busy (-1) status of one or all of the machine's three sound channels, according to its lone argument:

  * 0: all channels
  * 1: channel A
  * 2: channel B
  * 3: channel C

In [[:basics:msqb|MS-QB]], the arguments ON, OFF or STOP can be used not for the music itself as it might seem, but for the event triggering caused by this countdown, which can be captured by [[ON_PLAY|ON PLAY...GOSUB]] from 32 to 1 note(s) remaining.
