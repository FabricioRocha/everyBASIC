Loads into a buffer the contents of a disk sector

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */


In [[:basics:msx:|MSX BASIC]], the keyword was implemented by the [[:basics:msx:msxdisk|MSX DiskBASIC extension]]. DSKI$ takes two arguments:

  * a number from 0 to 6 which identifies the logical or physical disk drive, being 0 the current drive, 1 for drive A:, 2 for drive B: and so on;
  * the 512-byte sector number to be read. For a 360KB (80-track, single-sided) disk, it would be in the range 0-719; for a 720kB (80-track, double-sided) disk, a value from 0 to 1439. 

Apparently, the function would not return the contents to a regular string variable, but to a buffer region in memory where it could be accessed with [[PEEK]].
