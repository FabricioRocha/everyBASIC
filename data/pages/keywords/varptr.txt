====== VARPTR ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Returns the memory address of a variable, just as a pointer of other languages

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:msatari:]], [[:basics:trs80:level2]], [[:basics:trscolor:colorext]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]], [[:basics:msqb:QBasic]], [[:basics:VBDOS:]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]], [[:basics:ugBASIC:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:trscolor:colormc]] (undocumented), [[:basics:MSX:]] (negative value requires adding 65535), [[:basics:Gambas:]]

**Also written as: ** /* Alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later. */

VARPTR works kinda like the & operator before a variable's name in the C language.
