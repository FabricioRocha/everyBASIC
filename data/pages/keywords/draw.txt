====== DRAW ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

A plotting, "turtle-like" statement which takes a string of coded commands for drawing lines from a starting point. 

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:ANSI:ansifull]], [[:basics:Applesoft:]], [[:basics:CBM:cbmv7]], [[:basics:CBM:cbmv3.5]], [[:basics:Sinclair:spectrum]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:MSX:]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:CBM:Simons1]], [[:basics:ugBASIC:]] (coordinates and DRAW TO form)

**Also written as: ** /* Alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later. */

===== Usage =====



==== Variations ====
Instead of the "turtle commands" of other MS BASICs DRAW, the [[:basics:applesoft|Applesoft]] apparently works with a predefined shape (*TO DO:* no further details on that so far).
