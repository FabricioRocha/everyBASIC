====== CSRLIN ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Returns, as an integer, the line number where the console cursor is at

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

Found from later versions of [[:basics:ms80|Microsoft BASIC]] onwards, "CurSoR LINe" can be either implemented as a function (as in [[:basics:msx|MSX BASIC]] or as a special variable (as in [[:basics:gwbasic|GWBASIC]]). Usage is the same: attributed to a numerical variable, it returns the integer number of the current vertical coordinate of the text cursor.

  IF CSRLIN = 1 THEN PRINT "Top of screen"

The topmost line number is 1 in GWBASIC; its manual says that 25 is the maximum value and does not tell what happens if the screen has more lines, up to 43 in some special modes of the IBM-PC and compatibles.
