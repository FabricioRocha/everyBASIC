====== ACOS ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Returns the arc-cosine of a number given as an argument from -1 to 1

  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Comments =====
The arc-cosine is the inverse function of the cosine trigonometric function. It is the length of the arc whose cosine is its argument, and, as a proportion from 0 to 1 of the circle radius, this is the same as the angle, in radians, whose cosine is the argument.

The arc-cosine function can only result in real values if given a value in the range of -1 to 1; a runtime error will happen otherwise.
