====== INT ======

Returns the integer value immediately lesser than or equal to the given number, also with a negative argument.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

INT has been for long the math floor function of BASIC, to round fractional numbers down to the nearest lesser integer. This is not the same thing of a simple cut off of whatever comes after a decimal point, like [[FIX]] does. The difference is visible when the number to be converted is negative:

<code gwbasic>
10 A = -12.35
20 PRINT INT(A)    ' shows "-13"
30 PRINT FIX(A)    ' shows "-12"
</code>


==== Variations ====

In [[:basics:applesoft|Applesoft FP BASIC]] in the Apple II Plus and later computers, INT can also be used as a command, without arguments, for clearing the memory and starting [[:basics:a2int|INTEGER BASIC]].


===== Examples =====
/*
  Below is an example of a code block, using GeSHi syntax highlighting for //gwbasic//. Other styles of interest might be
  //basic4gl//, //blitzbasic//, //freebasic//, //gambas//, //locobasic//, //purebasic//, //qbasic//, //sdlbasic//,
  //thinbasic//, //vb//, //vbnet//, //xbasic// or //zxbasic//. 

  <code gwbasic>
  10 PRINT "HELLO"
  </code>
*/



===== Comments =====
INT is one of the functions implemented since [[:basics:dartmouth:|Dartmouth BASIC First Edition]], but originally it worked more like the later [[FIX]] function for negative numbers. The manual for [[:basics:dartmouth:dartmouth2|Second Edition/CARDBASIC]] states it clearly: //"INT always operates by chopping off the fractional part".// It became the "true floor" function in BASIC only from [[:basics:dartmouth:dartmouth3|Dartmouth Third Edition]] onwards ((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_BASIC#Third_Edition)).
