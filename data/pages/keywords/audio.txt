Suspends or turns sound channels off or on; also used for allowing sound from a cassette player to be passed to a TV used as monitor

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

In the original [[:basics:ABasiC:|Amiga BASIC]], AUDIO was used along [[SOUND]] as a switch for any or all of the Amiga's 4 sound channels at once.

Its first parameter was an integer number between 0 and 15, whose binary representation would be used as a mask for right-to-left, 0 to 3 channel selection: 11, for example, as 1011 in binary, would make the statement act on channels 0, 1 and 3.

The second argument is an integer representing the action itself:

  * -1 disables sound on the selected channel(s) and wipes away the current SOUND configured there.
  * 0 suspends sound on the selected channel(s). The SOUNDs configured for such channel(s) are kept in memory, and a further call to AUDIO with 1 or any positive integer will make them play again.
  * 1 (or any positive integer) resumes SOUND in the selected channel(s).

<code freebasic>
  ' Disable sound on channel 2
  AUDIO 4, -1
  
  ' Resume sound on channels 2 and 0
  AUDIO 5, 1
</code>

==== Variations ====

In the [[:basics:trscolor:|TRS Color]] BASIC, AUDIO is used for enabling or disabling sound passthrough from the cassette player used as secondary memory to the television set eventually used for video output. This would //presumably// allow for analog music and sounds intertwined with software on a tape to be used in games and such, probably before //multimedia// was a term found in printed material.
