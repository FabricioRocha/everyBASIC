Boolean function to test if the Nth bit is set on a given number

  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
This function returns //true// or //false// if, on a given number passed as its first argument, the bit in the Nth position, given as second argument, is respectively 1 or 0. Bit positions are counted from right to left, 0 being the rightmost bit.

<code gambas>
bolResult = BTst(15, 3)  'true
bolResult = BTst(15, 4)  'false
