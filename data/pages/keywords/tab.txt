/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Moves the text cursor to the given horizontal position (column), among outputs from [[PRINT]] and alikes

  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.

  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
TAB is meant to be used before or among [[PRINT]], [[LPRINT]] and other text output statements.

In spite of returning nothing, TAB is often implemented as a function, at least by requiring parenthesis around its argument.



==== Variations ====

In [[basics:msx|MSX BASIC]], the argument to TAB can not be bigger than 255.

[[basics:a2int|Apple INTEGER BASIC]] implemented TAB like a proper statement, and required no parenthesis around its argument.
