====== RENUM ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Short for [[RENUMBER]] and does pretty much the same, despite different features sometimes: changes the numbers of lines of a program stored in memory.

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
RENUM is an interpreter command in line-numbered BASICs and will blow your machine if used as a statement within a program in most if not all BASICs. Well, sort of.

Microsoft line-numbered BASICs such as [[:basics:GWBASIC:|GWBASIC]] and [[:basics:MSX:|MSX]] allow different quantities of arguments. The last one is the new //increment// to apply in every next line number: it is mandatory and must be higher than 1. The first (mandatory) and second (optional) arguments are, respectively, the //new// number of the first line to be renumbered and the //old// line number from which the new number sequence will be applied.
 
<code gwbasic>
  ' Make the program start from line 100, with a 10 gap between every line
  RENUM 100,,10
  
  ' Maybe after merging code into your program you might want it in a lower line range, from 10000 to 2000 here
  RENUM 2000, 10000, 10
</code>

Line numbers used as //targets// for program flow statements such as [[ELSE]], [[GOSUB]], [[GOTO]], [[THEN]], [[RESUME]], [[RETURN]] etc. will be also automatically updated by RENUM in GWBASIC and [[:basics:MSX:|MSX BASIC]].

==== Variations ====

GWBASIC allows both arguments to be replaced by a dot (.), meaning "the lastly edited line".
