===== Usage =====

It's been only a matter of typing `LIST` on the BASIC screen. If there were no lines stored in memory (the ones which were typed with a line number first), usually nothing would be shown but the interpreter prompt.

===== Examples =====



===== Comments =====
LIST was especially important in machines where a real text editor was not used for writing code.

===== Related keywords =====
/* Keywords that are often or always used along this one */

===== Similar keywords =====
/* Keywords with the same or similar functionality found in other versions of BASIC */

===== In other languages... =====
/* For parallels and comparisons with other modern-day languages */

===== Other tags =====


===== References =====
/* If you used the ((citation)) syntax elsewhere in the text, they will appear under this section. But you can write some recommendations of books, magazines, etc */
