====== NAME ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Changes the name of a file on disk; in some implementations is used for renumbering lines and references to them

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
In most Microsoft-based BASICs where it exists, NAME is a disk-only, file-related command implemented by extensions, interpreters or compilers with disk support. It takes a //current file name//, the [[AS]] particle and a //new name//:

  NAME "TEST.BAS" AS "MYPROG1.BAS"

If the system supports multiple virtual and/or physical disk drives, the unit specifier may precede filenames. MSX and IBM-PC Microsoft BASICs will use the familiar single-letter-and-colon pattern:

  NAME "A:TEST.BAS" AS "A:MYPROG1.BAS"

Uncertain behaviour might be expected if different drive specifiers are used for the old and new name.

Directory paths are also supported in BASICs that run on an hierarchical filesystem, such as the MS-QB family. Supposedly they should only be allowed with the //current// file name; it remains to be checked what happens if //current// and //new// file names contain paths, both equal and different.
   


==== Variations ====

TRS-80 BASICs had a different application for NAME: renumbering program lines, just like [[RENUM]] in other Microsoft-derived BASICs.

  NAME 100, 10, 10

Check the [[RENUM]] page for an explanation on the arguments. In [[:basics:trs80:level3|TRS-80 Level III BASIC]], the command automatically updates the target lines of [[GOTO]], [[GOSUB]], [[THEN]], [[ELSE]], [[RESUME]], [[INPUT]]#LEN, [[ON-GOTO]] and [[ON-GOSUB]].

The [[:basics:ANSI:ansifull|ANSI Standard "Full" specification]] lists NAME as one of the "core attributes" for files that could be used in the list of arguments of an [[OPEN]] or [[ASK]] statement:

<code purebasic>
OPEN #3: NAME "myfile"

! The following command results in "myfile" being stored in N$:
ASK #3: NAME N$
</code>

The specification is incredibly confusing about //anything// and whether a file can be renamed is no exception. [[SET]] is mentioned as one of the commands that provide "file operations" (section 11, //caput//), so it //might// be possible to use something like ''SET #3: NAME "newname'', but further mentions to SET in the section are apparently restricted to is usage with "pointer control" as part of the so-called "record operations".

  <code gwbasic>
  10 PRINT "HELLO"
  </code>
