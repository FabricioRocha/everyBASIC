===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

In [[:basics:msx:|MSX BASIC]], this statement is implemented by the [[:basics:msx:msxdisk|MSX DiskBASIC extension]]. It does not look like a function but requires two comma-separated arguments:
  * a number which identifies the disk drive, being 0 the current drive, 1 for drive A:, 2 for drive B: and so on up to 6. Disk swapping may be required in a system with only one physical drive.
  * the number of the 512-byte disk sector to be written to.

The content to be written to disk must be [[POKE]]d into a buffer area in memory, whose address is stored as a 16-bit integer in &HF351 and &HF352.
