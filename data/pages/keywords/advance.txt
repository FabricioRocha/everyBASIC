====== ADVANCE ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Moves the cursor of a random-access file forward by a number of data items (fields?), even through different records

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:hptsb:]]

**With variations:** 

**Also written as: ** 

===== Usage =====
The ADVANCE statement as implemented by [[:basics:hptsb|HP Time-Shared BASIC]] requires:
  * a file handler/number, followed by a semicolon
  * an integer "skip count" or expression which tells the number of items to advance
  * an integer variable which will receive information about the execution:
      * 0 if the movement could be performed without problems
      * the number of items which could not be jumped due to an End-Of-File mark

  ''230 ADVANCE #3; 10, R''
