====== WIDTH ======
Allows the user to configure the number of characters in each line of a text area, screen, file or device; may set the number of screen lines as well

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:CBM:cbmv7]], [[:basics:trscolor:colorenh]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:MSX:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:bwbasic:bw32]], [[:basics:ugBASIC:]] (alias for [[SCREEN]] WIDTH)

**Also written as: ** /* Alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later. */

===== Usage =====



==== Variations ====
WIDTH arguments are not exactly a standard.

A number after the desired number of characters (text //columns//, as some say) has different meanings:
  * In [[:basics:msamiga|MS Amiga BASIC]], sets the number of characters among tab stops.
  * In [[:basics:msqb]], if the first argument was not a device/file handler, it sets the number of desired lines on the screen: for the PC, it could be 25, 30, 43, 50 or 60.

<code zxbasic>
WIDTH 62,3
