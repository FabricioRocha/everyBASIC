====== POP ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Breaks execution out of a [[FOR]]...[[NEXT]] loop or forces [[RETURN]] to jump back to the //previous// [[GOSUB]]

  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:a2int:]], [[:basics:Applesoft:]], [[:basics:Atari:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:bw32]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:ugBASIC:]] (also as POP PROC)

**Also written as: ** 

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
POP is a kinda weird and dangerous command.

In [[:basics:a2int|Apple INTEGER BASIC]], its purpose was to allow early break of a [[FOR]]...[[NEXT]] loop.

In [[:basics:applesoft|Applesoft BASIC]], the same word is used for altering the //call stack//: when used, the next [[RETURN]] statement will not pass execution back to the instruction right after the [[GOSUB]] which called the subroutine. Instead, execution will jump back to instruction following the //second to last// [[GOSUB]] which had been used.
