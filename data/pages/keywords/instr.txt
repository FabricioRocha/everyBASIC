===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
INSTR returns the position of the first character of a given string within another given string.

In some Microsoft BASICs at least, such as [[:basics:MSX]], 0 would be returned if the substring could not be found, meaning that the character count of the searched string started at 1. Syntax is:

  X = INSTR(?startpos?, haystr, needlestr)

where:

  * ''?startpos?'' is an optional start position from where the search would be performed
  * ''haystr'' is the string to be scanned for the occurence of the substring
  * ''needlestr'' is the substring we are trying to find in ''haystr''

==== Variations ====

In [[:basics:bbc|BBC BASIC]], the optional start position for the search was the last parameter, after the "hay" and the "needle" arguments.
