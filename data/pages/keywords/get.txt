====== GET ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Reads a record from a device or random-access file; in some BASICs reads the next character eventually available from the keyboard; may also copy an area of a graphic screen

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */


==== Variations ====

In the Applesoft-ish [[:basics:applesoft:mpf2|Micro-Professor BASIC]] and early [[:basics:acorn|Acorn BASIC]], the GET keyword was somewhat similar in functionality of [[INKEY-S|INKEY$]] found in other BASICs, but there is a significant difference: GET works in //blocking mode//. Just like [[INPUT]], it sits and waits until a key is pressed. It dispenses the usual INKEY$ loop so common in menus, for example, but it will not work for games. [[PEEK]] and [[POKE]] workarounds would allow INKEY$ simulation with detection of keyboard scan codes and further conversion to ASCII character codes ((//"A Função INKEY$ no TK-2000"//: INPUT (Brazilian edition) vol. 2, p. 496-499. Nova Cultural, 1986, Brasil)) ((//"Right..Up...Left...Fire!"//: INPUT (British edition) vol 1, p.55. Marshall-Cavendish, 1985, England. Available online in https://archive.org/details/Input_Vol_1_No_02_1997_Marshall_Cavendish_GB/page/n23/mode/2up last checked 2023-02-18)).
