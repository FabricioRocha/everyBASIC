====== ERR ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Returns the code of the most recent error that happened

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:decbasic:]], [[:basics:msatari:]], [[:basics:trs80:level2]], [[:basics:trscolor:colorenh]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:MSX:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:bw32]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:TI994:ti994ext]] (through CALL), [[:basics:Atari:ataplus]] (with 0 returns error code, with 1 returns error line), [[:basics:Atari:atxl]] (with 0 returns error code, with 1 returns error line)

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */


==== Variations ====
With no apparent effect on its usage, ERR is documented not as a function, but as a //system variable// by [[:basics:gwbasic|GW-BASIC]] documentation.


===== Examples =====
/*
  Below is an example of a code block, using GeSHi syntax highlighting for //gwbasic//. Other styles of interest might be
  //basic4gl//, //blitzbasic//, //freebasic//, //gambas//, //locobasic//, //purebasic//, //qbasic//, //sdlbasic//,
  //thinbasic//, //vb//, //vbnet//, //xbasic// or //zxbasic//. 

  <code gwbasic>
  10 PRINT "HELLO"
  </code>

===== Comments =====
/* Origin of the keyword, opinions, history... */

Applesoft BASIC users do not have ERR; they can read the error code from memory with ''PEEK (222)'', at least on the Apple IIe ((https://archive.org/details/applesoft-basic-programmers-reference-manual-vol-1-for-iie-only/page/68)).
