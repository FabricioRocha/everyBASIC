====== CINT ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Returns the value of the given floating-point value rounded to the nearest integer

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:trs80:level2]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:MSX:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:bw32]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:Altair:altair12K]] (always converts to the lesser integer; overflows in values out of 16-bit range), [[:basics:Gambas:]]

**Also written as: ** 

===== Usage =====
<code gwbasic>
10 PRINT CINT(41.49)   ' shows "41"
20 PRINT CINT(41.51)   ' shows "42"
</code>


==== Variations ====
Microsoft BASICs which implement CINT usually limit its argument to the 16-bit signed range of -32768 to 32767. A lesser or greater input value causes an overflow error. [[CLNG]] allows for bigger numbers, in the 32-bit signed range.

The official documentation of [[:basics:bwbasic|Bywater BASIC 2.20]] described CINT as //"returns the truncated integer for the argument"//, which is equivalent to the [[FIX]] function that it did not implement; both keywords were implemented with their common behaviours in version 3.20.
