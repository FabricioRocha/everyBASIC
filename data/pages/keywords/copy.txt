====== COPY ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Copies a file to the same or a different disk

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.
*/

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:CBM:cbmv4]], [[:basics:CBM:cbmv7]], [[:basics:CBM:cbmv3.5]], [[:basics:Sinclair:spectrum]], [[:basics:Gambas:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:CBM:Simons1]], [[:basics:Sinclair:]]

===== Usage =====
COPY allowed MS-DOS-style drive letters for physical or logical disks. In systems with a single disk drive, A: and B: would cause various prompts for disk swapping. If drive letters were ommited, COPY would create a file with a different name in the same disk.

'''COPY A:LETTER.TXT B:LETTER.TXT'''
'''COPY LETTER.TXT LETTER.BKP'''
