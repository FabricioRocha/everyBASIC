  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====

[[:basics:msqb|MS QuickBASIC]] allows both an assignment of a new value to an environment variable and its retrieval. More over, the function may receive a number as argument, for returning the value of the Nth environment variable.
