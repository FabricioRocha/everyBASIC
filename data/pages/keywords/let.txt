====== LET ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Assigns a value or expression to a variable; optional usage in most BASICs

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:Dartmouth:dartmouth1]], [[:basics:ANSI:ansimin]], [[:basics:ANSI:ansifull]], [[:basics:hptsb:]], [[:basics:decbasic:]], [[:basics:Altair:]], [[:basics:a2int:]], [[:basics:Applesoft:]], [[:basics:TI994:]], [[:basics:CBM:]], [[:basics:Atari:]], [[:basics:msatari:]], [[:basics:trs80:]], [[:basics:trs80:level2]], [[:basics:trscolor:colormc]], [[:basics:Sinclair:zx81]], [[:basics:Sinclair:spectrum]], [[:basics:BBC:]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:MSX:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:bw32]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]], [[:basics:msqb:QBasic]], [[:basics:VBDOS:]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]], [[:basics:Gambas:]], [[:basics:minibasicmm:]], [[:basics:minibasicjs:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:TI994:ti994ext]] (accepting comma-separated list of variables), [[:basics:Atari:ataplus]] (mandatory for variables with names starting with or equal to reserved keywords), [[:basics:Atari:atxl]] (mandatory for variables with names starting with or equal to reserved keywords), [[:basics:Sinclair:]] (mandatory for ZX80), [[:basics:Atom:]] (not for array assignment)

===== Usage =====
With or without line numbers, LET introduces any assignment as in:

''LET A = SIN(X)''

In most BASICs it can simply be left out, and assignments will work anyway.


==== Variations ====
LET is almost always optional, but in some implementations it is mandatory for assignments, such as in [[:basics:sinclair:zx80|Sinclair ZX-80 4k BASIC]].


===== Examples =====

  //thinbasic//, //vb//, //vbnet//, //xbasic// or //zxbasic//. 

  <code gwbasic>
  10 PRINT "HELLO"
  </code>

===== Comments =====
LET is one of the original keywords of the BASIC languages and must have been implemented by every single BASIC since [[:basics:dartmouth]], but it did not take long until it became optional in almost every implementation.


===== Related keywords =====
/* Keywords that are often or always used along this one */


===== Similar keywords =====
/* Keywords with the same or similar functionality found in other versions of BASIC */


===== In other languages... =====
/* For parallels and comparisons with other modern-day languages */
Assignment commands are not usual in other programming languages.

In Tcl/Tk, the ''set'' keyword performs pretty much like LET and is mandatory in every assignment, as Tcl/Tk syntax is positional and always requires a command as its first word of a sentence.
