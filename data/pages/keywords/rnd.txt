  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:ANSI:ansimin]], [[:basics:hptsb:]], [[:basics:decbasic:]], [[:basics:Altair:]], [[:basics:a2int:]], [[:basics:Applesoft:]], [[:basics:TI994:]], [[:basics:CBM:]], [[:basics:msatari:]], [[:basics:trs80:level2]], [[:basics:trscolor:colormc]], [[:basics:Sinclair:]], [[:basics:GWBASIC:]], [[:basics:MSX:]], [[:basics:bwbasic:]], [[:basics:ABasiC:]], [[:basics:VBDOS:]], [[:basics:FreeBASIC:]], [[:basics:minibasicmm:]], [[:basics:EndBASIC:]]

**With variations:** [[:basics:Dartmouth:dartmouth1]] (return value between 0 and 1; argument ignored), [[:basics:Atari:]] (only 0 <= x < 1), [[:basics:trs80:]] (range variations: 0 for 0 to 1, N for 1 to N), [[:basics:trscolor:]] (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to N), [[:basics:bwbasic:bw32]], [[:basics:msqb:QBasic]] (only between 0 and 1), [[:basics:Gambas:]], [[:basics:ugBASIC:]] (integers, parameter sets upper bound)

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */


==== Variations ====
[[:basics:bwBASIC]] admittedly ignores any eventually passed argument.

[[:basics:msx|MSX BASIC]] allows three different behaviors for RND according to the argument:
  * 1 or more: returns a different value returned for each call
  * 0: returns the same value returned in the previous call
  * -1 or less: for each different argument value, returns always the same value

In [[:basics:a2int|Apple INTEGER BASIC]], which obviously would not return a number between 0 and 1, the argument passed to RND defines the highest value of the 0-started range which can be returned.
