====== AUTO ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Command used for automatic creation of line numbers while a program is being typed in

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
AUTO is typically found in the old-style BASIC interpreters where the same "immediate" interface was used for typing in numbered lines of statements to be stored in memory as a program. In its most usual form, just typing ''AUTO'' and the keyboard Enter or Return key will print a line number and a cursor in the following line of the screen.

Optional arguments are often available both for setting the initial line number and the increment for the following lines. In MSX BASIC, for example:

  AUTO 100,10

will result in a sequence of lines like 100, 110, 120, 130 and so on, until the user presses the key combination CTRL+STOP. Just pressing Enter/Return after the number, as an empty line, might stop AUTO as well on some BASICs.
