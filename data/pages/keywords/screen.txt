===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

SCREEN is found in some Microsoft-based BASICs from the 8-bit era onwards as a statement to initialize various text or graphic modes. Apart from that brief common definition, there is little in common among its implementations due to hardware capabilities.

Let's start with a syntax comparison. Optional parameters between [ and ]:

  * ''SCREEN mode, colorset'' in [[:basics:trscolor:colorext|Extended Color BASIC]]
  * ''SCREEN mode [,colordepth] [,startline]'' in [[:basics:ABasiC|Amiga ABasiC]]
  * ''SCREEN id, cols, lins, colorbits, mode'' in [[:basics::msamiga]]
  * ''SCREEN mode [,bolColor] [,activepage] [,visiblepage]'' in the [[:basics:msqb|MS-QuickBASIC]] family
  * ''SCREEN mode [,spritesize] [,bolKeyclick] [,casspeed] [,prntype]'' in [[:basics:msx|MSX BASIC]]

=== Extended Color BASIC ===
<code locobasic>
  SCREEN mode, colorset
</code>

  * //mode// - 0 for text, 1 for graphics
  * //colorset//
    * 0 - green, blue, yellow, red
    * 1 - cyan, magenta, orange, buff (light ocre)

=== MSX ===
<code locobasic>
SCREEN mode [,spritesize] [,bolKeyclick] [,casspeed] [,prntype]''
</code>
 
  * //mode//
    * 0 - basic text mode, 40x24 (6-bit wide character box)
    * 1 - text mode, 32x24 (8-bit wide character box)
    * 2 - high-resolution graphics: 256x192, 16 colors
    * 3 - low-resolution graphics: 64x48, 16 colors
  * //spritesize//
    * 0 - 8x8
    * 1 - 8x8 expanded
    * 2 - 16x16
    * 3 - 16x16 expanded
  * //bolKeyClick// - 0 turns off click sound when key is pressed; 1 turns this sound on
  * //casspeed// - 1 for 1200 characters per second; 2 for 2400 characters per second
  * //prntype// - seems to depend on implementation, but 0 for an ASCII-based national standard, 1 for MSX's standard

==== Variations ====
The [[:basics:msqb|MS-QuickBASIC]] family allows the usage of SCREEN as a function that returns the character code or the color currently found at given line and column of a text-mode screen. The optional third parameter, if 0 (default), means the character ASCII code will be returned; any other value causes the foreground color code to be returned.
