====== ONERR ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Sets an error-handling trap which jumps execution to a given line with [[GOTO]]

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

**Implemented by:** [[:basics:Applesoft:]]

**With variations:** 

**Also written as: ** 

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */
This is the [[:basics:applesoft|Applesoft]] equivalent to [[ON ERROR]] found in other BASICs.

It is known to have a "deficiency" that may cause a crash, as Wikipedia says((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC)), according to the //Applesoft BASIC Programmers Reference Manual//((https://archive.org/details/applesoft-basic-programmers-reference-manual-vol-1-for-iie-only)): if [[RESUME]] is not found in the error-handling routine, the system stack is not reset.
