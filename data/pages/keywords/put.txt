  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.
