====== READ ======
/* Remove the comments after creating content for each section.*/

Sequentially copies, to the given list of variables, the values found in [[DATA]] lines. Also used by some BASICs for reading the contents of a file.

/*
  For the lines below, just create links, separated by commas, to other pages of the BASICs section,
  like [[:basics:basicTagName]].
  
  "Implemented by" should mention BASICs which implement the keyword like described, in a more usual and standard way.
  
  "With variations" should point to BASICs where this keyword is used a bit differently.
  
  "Also written as" should list alternative spellings and abbreviations this keyword has. No need to
  refer to a BASIC, there is a section for that later.

===== Usage =====
/* For inline examples of syntax, write the keyword between '' and '' (two single quotes) */

In [[:basics:applesoft|Applesoft BASIC]], ''READ filename'' would open a sequential (text) file or a random-access file in a kind of stream mode: further [[INPUT]] and [[GET]] instructions would read from //filename// until a [[PRINT]] command containing a ''CTRL+D'' control character was issued((ALVES, Aventino. //Apple II Cartão de Referência//. LTC Editora S/A, Brasil, 1987)).
  * In the form ''READ filename,pos'', input would start from byte //pos// of the sequential file.
  * In the form ''READ filename,rec'', further input would start from record //rec// of the random-access file.
  * Optionally, ''READ filename,rec,pos'' would cause further input to be read from byte //pos// of record //rec//.
