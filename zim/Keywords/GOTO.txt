===== Comments =====
Made famous by Edsger Dijkstra, GOTO has its roots in machine code programming, just as much as the higher level languages which preceded BASIC and some others which came about later, and its functionality is still present in modern day code, even if covered by layers of syntatic sugar. Machine code is written, stored and executed sequentially until it //branches// because of a condition or even without one. And branches are made of jumps, which were very explicitely represented in early computer languages like BASIC.
